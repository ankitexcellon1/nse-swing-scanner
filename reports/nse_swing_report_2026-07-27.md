IQ200 Red-Team Review:
- Main objection: volume confirmation is weak, so breakout/follow-through may fail.
- Relative strength concern: the stock is not clearly outperforming Nifty.
- Trade-plan concern: target versus stop-loss does not justify the risk.
- Avoid entry if the stock opens with a large gap-up, fails near resistance, or market direction turns weak.
